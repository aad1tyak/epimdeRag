PROMPT:
You are responsible for generating a valid SEIR model XML file using:

- model_diagram (image): This shows all compartments and directional flows.
- user_input (text): Provides parameter values, population numbers, and formulas.
- language_specification (text): Defines strict XML structure. Do not change required lines.

Instructions:
1. Extract compartments and transitions from the image (left to right, top-down if needed).
2. Use `user_input` to fill rates, formulas, and initial values.
3. Follow the XML structure exactly. No extra text or formatting.
4. Use 0-based indexing for compartments in order of appearance.
5. If any info is unclear, use `<!-- missing info -->` as placeholder.

Only return the final XML file.

********************************************************************************
USER INPUT:
No Parameters provided, use the provided image to get the useful informations.

  RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING THIS FILE:

  1. You may ONLY define <compartments> with optional <outgoingFlows>. Nothing else (no <population>, <parameters>, etc.).
  2. Each <compartments> block must include:
      - PrimaryName: The general type of the compartment (e.g., Susceptible, Infected, etc.)
      - SecondaryName: A specific group/label that makes this compartment unique among others of the same PrimaryName.That's why if there is no group compartment, then there is no need to write secondaryName parameter at all. 
        NOTE: Each PrimaryName may be reused, but each (PrimaryName, SecondaryName) pair must be unique.
  3. You may add zero or more <outgoingFlows> inside each <compartments> block.
      - Each flow must contain:
          • rate: A strictly numeric value(sometimes you need to get a numeric answer by solving provided equations using provided parameters).
          • target: The **0-based index** of the destination compartment, in the format `//@compartments.X`, where X is the index.
          • description: (optional) A plain-language explanation of the flow.
      - You must **strictly maintain compartment order** because indexing depends on the order of declaration.
      - A single flow must only target ONE compartment.
  4. IMPORTANT: All `rate` values MUST be evaluated and written as floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.0375). NEVER leave them as symbolic expressions (e.g., 0.44 * 7 * 79 / (2446 + 79)). You have all required values — calculate them.
  4. DO NOT use any undefined keywords or fields like `.population`.
  5. DO NOT include any comments unless necessary to indicate missing or ambiguous information.

<!-- Begin your model definition below. Follow all rules strictly. -->

<compartments PrimaryName="PrimaryNameHere" SecondaryName="SecondaryNameHere">
  <outgoingFlows 
    rate="SOME_NUMERIC_RATE" 
    target="//@compartments.TARGET_INDEX_HERE" 
    description="Optional description of the transition" />
</compartments>

<!-- Add more <compartments> as needed, making sure to follow indexing strictly. -->

<!-- DO NOT ALTER THE LINE BELOW. It is system-required and must appear exactly as shown. -->
