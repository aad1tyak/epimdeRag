PROMPT:
You are now responsible for generating a complete SEIR model XML file using only the provided user input, image and language specification/metamodel of seirmodel.
Do not assume any external context or missing information. Everything you need has already been provided.

- model_diagram (image): This shows all compartments and directional flows.
- user_input (text): Provides parameter values, population numbers, and formulas.
- language_specification/metamodel (text): Make use of this file to understand the required XML structure and elements.

Instructions:
1. Extract compartments and transitions from the image (left to right, top-down if needed).
2. Use `user_input` to fill rates, formulas, and initial values.
3. Follow the XML structure exactly. No extra text or formatting.
4. Use 0-based indexing for compartments in order of appearance.
5. If any info is unclear, use `<!-- missing info -->` as placeholder.

Only return the final XML file.

| ∅ → S       | Birth into Susceptible  | **µN**                      |


| Parameter | Meaning                                          | Value (from paper)                   |

| β         | Contact (transmission) rate                      | **0.21/day**                         |
| γ         | Recovery rate (1/γ is infectious period)         | **1/14 days** → γ ≈ **0.0714/day**   |
| σ         | Latency rate (1/σ is incubation period)          | **1/7 days** → σ ≈ **0.143/day**     |
| ω         | Immunity loss rate (1/ω is duration of immunity) | **1/365 days** → ω ≈ **0.00274/day** |
| µ         | Background birth/death rate                      | **1/76 years** → µ ≈ **3.6e-5/day**  |
| α         | Infection-induced mortality rate                 | **0** (assumed zero for this model)  |

  RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING THIS FILE:

  1. You may ONLY define <compartments> with optional <outgoingFlows>. Nothing else (no <population>, <parameters>, etc.).
  2. Each <compartments> block must include:
      - PrimaryName: The general type of the compartment (e.g., Susceptible, Infected, etc.)
      - SecondaryName: A specific group/label that makes this compartment unique among others of the same PrimaryName.That's why if there is no group compartment, then there is no need to write secondaryName parameter at all. 
        NOTE: Each PrimaryName may be reused, but each (PrimaryName, SecondaryName) pair must be unique.
  3. You may add zero or more <outgoingFlows> inside each <compartments> block.
      - Each flow must contain:
          • rate: A strictly numeric value(sometimes you need to get a numeric answer by solving provided equations using provided parameters).
          • target: The **0-based index** of the destination compartment, in the format `//@compartments.X`, where X is the index.
          • description: (optional) A plain-language explanation of the flow.
      - You must **strictly maintain compartment order** because indexing depends on the order of declaration.
      - A single flow must only target ONE compartment.
  4. IMPORTANT: All `rate` values MUST be evaluated and written as floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.0375). NEVER leave them as symbolic expressions (e.g., 0.44 * 7 * 79 / (2446 + 79)). You have all required values — calculate them.
  4. DO NOT use any undefined keywords or fields like `.population`.
  5. DO NOT include any comments unless necessary to indicate missing or ambiguous information.

FINAL VERDICT:
-Wrong target values for birth inflow, actually the paper doesn't provide sufficent information to get the value for birth flow. 
- S->E flow had incorrect value.
-Incorrect use of outgoingflows for birth, its a inflow which cannot be possible in epimde model.
