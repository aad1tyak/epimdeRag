PROMPT:
You are now responsible for generating a complete SEIR model XML file using only the provided user input, image and language specification/metamodel of seirmodel.
Do not assume any external context or missing information. Everything you need has already been provided.

- model_diagram (image): This shows all compartments and directional flows.
- user_input (text): Provides parameter values, population numbers, and formulas.
- language_specification/metamodel (text): Make use of this file to understand the required XML structure and elements.

Instructions:
1. Extract compartments and transitions from the image (left to right, top-down if needed).
2. Use `user_input` to fill rates, formulas, and initial values.
3. Follow the XML structure exactly. No extra text or formatting.
4. Use 0-based indexing for compartments in order of appearance.
5. If any info is unclear, use `<!-- missing info -->` as placeholder.

Only return the final XML file.

USER INPUT:
The provided data describes a compartmental epidemiological model, likely representing the progression of a disease (e.g., COVID-19) through various stages of infection and treatment. The model includes compartments representing different stages of infection severity, isolation status, and hospitalization.  The transition rates between compartments are provided as numerical values.  The table below summarizes the parameters.  Note that several parameters lack a formal equation as they are defined by their numerical transition rates.  Further research or context would be needed to derive more complex equations reflecting underlying epidemiological processes.
