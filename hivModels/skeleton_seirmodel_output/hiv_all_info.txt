PROMPT:
You are now responsible for generating a complete SEIR model XML file using only the provided user input and XML language specification.
Do not assume any external context or missing information. Everything you need has already been provided.

You have access to:
- user_input: This includes all necessary compartment types, groups, and flows.
- language_specification: A skeleton XML that defines structure and format. Follow it exactly. Do not alter required lines.

Your output must be:
1. A valid and complete XML file in the format shown in the skeleton.
2. Use only the information given in user_input.
3. Output ONLY the XML file — no extra comments, notes, formatting, or text outside the XML.
4. If something is unclear, use a placeholder value with a comment like <!-- missing info -->.
5. The output will be parsed by a strict system. Maintain clean structure and formatting.

********************************************************************************
USER INPUT:
Compartment Names with indexes:
0. Recruitment (Homosexual Men)
1. Recruitment (Women)
2. Recruitment (Heterosexual Men)
3. Susceptible (Homosexual Men)
4. Susceptible (Women)
5. Susceptible (Heterosexual Men)
6. Untreated Infected (Homosexual Men)
7. Untreated Infected (Women)
8. Untreated Infected (Heterosexual Men)
9. Treated with ART
10. People living with AIDS
11. Death due to AIDS
12. Natural Death


Flow direction and their parameters values:
Recruitment → Susceptible (Homosexual Men): 333 * 0.48 * (1 - 0.92) = 12.7872
Recruitment → Susceptible (Women): 333 * (1 - 0.48) = 173.16
Recruitment → Susceptible (Heterosexual Men): 333 * 0.48 * 0.92 = 147.0528

Susceptible (Homosexual Men) → Untreated Infected (Homosexual Men): λh = 0.44 * 7 * 79 / (2446 + 79) ≈ 0.09636
Susceptible (Homosexual Men) → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

Susceptible (Women) → Untreated Infected (Women):  
- λhw (from homosexual men) = 0.018 * 2 * 79 / (2446 + 171173 + 79 + 29) ≈ 1.637E-5  
- λm (from women) = 0.02 * 4 * 6 / (189994 + 6) ≈ 1.355E-5  
Susceptible (Women) → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

Susceptible (Heterosexual Men) → Untreated Infected (Heterosexual Men):  
- λw (from heterosexual men) = 0.02 * 4 * 29 / (171173 + 29) ≈ 2.5E-6  
- λhm (from homosexual men) = 0.25 * 1 * 79 / (2446 + 171173 + 79 + 29) ≈ 1.1368E-4  
Susceptible (Heterosexual Men) → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

Untreated Infected → Treated with ART: α * p = 0.3333 * 0.9 = 0.29997  
Untreated Infected → People living with AIDS: α * (1 - p) = 0.3333 * 0.1 = 0.03333  
Untreated Infected → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

Treated with ART → People living with AIDS: δ = 0.018  
Treated with ART → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

People living with AIDS → Death due to AIDS: d = 0.3333  
People living with AIDS → Natural Death: μ = 0.0129

  RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING THIS FILE:

  1. You may ONLY define <compartments> with optional <outgoingFlows>. Nothing else (no <population>, <parameters>, etc.).
  2. Each <compartments> block must include:
      - PrimaryName: The general type of the compartment (e.g., Susceptible, Infected, etc.)
      - SecondaryName: A specific group/label that makes this compartment unique among others of the same PrimaryName.That's why if there is no group compartment, then there is no need to write secondaryName parameter at all. 
        NOTE: Each PrimaryName may be reused, but each (PrimaryName, SecondaryName) pair must be unique.
  3. You may add zero or more <outgoingFlows> inside each <compartments> block.
      - Each flow must contain:
          • rate: A strictly numeric value(sometimes you need to get a numeric answer by solving provided equations using provided parameters).
          • target: The **0-based index** of the destination compartment, in the format `//@compartments.X`, where X is the index.
          • description: (optional) A plain-language explanation of the flow.
      - You must **strictly maintain compartment order** because indexing depends on the order of declaration.
      - A single flow must only target ONE compartment.
  4. IMPORTANT: All `rate` values MUST be evaluated and written as floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.0375). NEVER leave them as symbolic expressions (e.g., 0.44 * 7 * 79 / (2446 + 79)). You have all required values — calculate them.
  4. DO NOT use any undefined keywords or fields like `.population`.
  5. DO NOT include any comments unless necessary to indicate missing or ambiguous information.

FINAL VERDICT:
Yes, the provided SEIR model file matches the master model in terms of:
-Flow directions (from/to compartments)
-Rate values

Even though the description text differs, the actual structure and parameter values are identical, meaning both models will produce the same results when run in a simulator.
