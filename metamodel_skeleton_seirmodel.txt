THIS IS SKELETON SEIRMODEL FILE WITH RULES ON HOW TO REPRODUCE:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<seir:SEIRModel xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:seir="http://example.com/seirmodel">

<!-- DO NOT ALTER THE ABOVE TWO LINES. They are system-required. If asked to return a SEIR model file, always include these two lines exactly as shown. -->

<!--
  RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING THIS FILE:

  1. You may ONLY define <compartments> with optional <outgoingFlows>. Nothing else (no <population>, <parameters>, etc.).
  2. Each <compartments> block must include:
      - PrimaryName: The general type of the compartment (e.g., Susceptible, Infected, etc.)
      - SecondaryName: A specific group/label that makes this compartment unique among others of the same PrimaryName.That's why if there is no group compartment, then there is no need to write secondaryName parameter at all. 
        NOTE: Each PrimaryName may be reused, but each (PrimaryName, SecondaryName) pair must be unique.
  3. You may add zero or more <outgoingFlows> inside each <compartments> block.
      - Each flow must contain:
          • rate: A strictly numeric value(sometimes you need to get a numeric answer by solving provided equations using provided parameters).
          • target: The **0-based index** of the destination compartment, in the format `//@compartments.X`, where X is the index.
          • description: (optional) A plain-language explanation of the flow.
      - You must **strictly maintain compartment order** because indexing depends on the order of declaration.
      - A single flow must only target ONE compartment.
  4. IMPORTANT: All `rate` values MUST be evaluated and written as floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.0375). NEVER leave them as symbolic expressions (e.g., 0.44 * 7 * 79 / (2446 + 79)). You have all required values — calculate them.
  4. DO NOT use any undefined keywords or fields like `.population`.
  5. DO NOT include any comments unless necessary to indicate missing or ambiguous information.

<!-- Begin your model definition below. Follow all rules strictly. -->

  <outgoingFlows 
    rate="SOME_NUMERIC_RATE" 
    target="//@compartments.TARGET_INDEX_HERE"

</compartments>

<!-- Add more <compartments> as needed, making sure to follow indexing strictly. -->

<!-- DO NOT ALTER THE LINE BELOW. It is system-required and must appear exactly as shown. -->
